# Project Description/Outline
The goal of this project is to assess housing prices around the country (United States) compared to the average salary for data scientists. 

# Extract

We will need to adjust the datasets so that they columns can more easily be joined. We will need to check for blank columns or other data that needs to be cleaned.
