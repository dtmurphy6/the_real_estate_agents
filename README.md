#Project Title The Real Estate Agents

#Team Members: Dan, Danielle, Kevin, Maite

#Project Description/Outline 
The goal of this project is to assess housing prices around the country compared to the average salary for data scientist. 

#Extract
We plan on using Redfin real esate data and Data scientist salary data from Kaggle. These are formatted as CSVs.

#Transform
We will need to adjust the datasets so that they columns can more easily be joined. We will need to check for blank columns or other data that needs to be cleaned.

#Load
We plan on storing our information in mongoDB (non-relational) and joining our two databases on city/state.
